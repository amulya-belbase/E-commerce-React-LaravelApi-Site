# E-commerce-React-LaravelApi-Site
React-Laravel-Ecommerce-Project
It's a side project that uses React for all the frontend interactions and Laravel for all the backend operations. Laravel RESTful APIs are integrated into the React components for different CRUD functionalities. 
APIs are tested through Postman platform before the frontend integration.
A user can register for an account (wherein email should be unique for each user). Upon successful registration, email notification is sent to that user's email account (tested using mailtrap) and then the user is redirected to login page. 
After login, user is taken to the main page. The main page consists of all the products in the system. User can add products into the cart. User can also search for products. User can add products of their liking into the system as well. 
If they've created products themselves, then they can edit/delete those said products. Cart component consists of all the "add to cart" products. User can remove products from their cart. Frontend validation is applied to all the form related operations.
